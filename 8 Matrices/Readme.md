# 8 - Matrices

This week we want to introduce support for a new data type into the `test_util` library.
The function `assertEqualMatrices(Matrix left, Matrix right)` shall be implemented.
When calling the function it shall output the row and the column of the first element that
is different between the left and the right matrix.
In the header `matrix.h` we provide a definition of the data structure.
