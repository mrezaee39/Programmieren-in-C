# Programming C Exercise
Here you will find weekly exercises accompanying the
lecture "Programmieren in C". The exercise starts
with the second week of the lecture. This list will be updated
as we progress. **Important**: Exercises not listed here are still subject to change,
so do not work ahead of this list.

* [Week 2 - First C Program](2 First C Program/Readme.md)
* [Week 3 - Building C Programs](3 Building C Programs/Readme.md)

## Using the Exercises
We strongly recommend using an IDE (e.g. CLion).
In the following we assume you are using CLion.

* Open your IDE
* If you happen to have an open project navigate to *File*->*Close Project*.
  This should open the project management dialog window.
* Click *Get From Version Control* and enter the url
    ```
    https://git.uni-due.de/embedded-systems/teaching/programming-c-sose-21.git
    ```
  and a path of your choice that determines where the project will be saved.

Every Week we will upload new content to the git repository.
To pull in any new changes hit `Ctrl+T`,
 check `Merge incoming changes into the current branch` and hit `Enter`
