# Programming C Exercise
Here you will find weekly exercises accompanying the
lecture "Programmieren in C". The exercise starts
with the second week of the lecture.

* [Week 2 - First C Program](https://git.uni-due.de/embedded-systems/exercises/programming-c/tree/master/2%20First%20C%20Program)
* [Week 3 - Building C Programs](https://git.uni-due.de/embedded-systems/exercises/programming-c/tree/master/3%20Building%20C%20Programs)

## Using the Exercises
We strongly recommend using an IDE (e.g. CLion).
In the following we assume you are using CLion.

* Open your IDE
* If you happen to have an open project navigate to *File*->*Close Project*.
  This should open the project management dialog window.
* Click *Get From Version Control* and enter the url
    ```
    https://git.uni-due.de/embedded-systems/exercises/programming-c.git
    ```
  and a path of your choice that determines where the project will be saved.

Every Week we will upload new content to the git repository.
To pull in any new changes hit `Ctrl+T`,
