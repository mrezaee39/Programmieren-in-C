# Chapter 7
This week you are in the role of a software developer in a company that is developing a backend for a machine learning framework.
You are responsible to realize the following feature:

> As a machine learning researcher I want to use a `dot` function in C, so I can calculate the dot product of two vectors efficiently and in an easy to read way.

The above is an example of a so-called *user story*. Your job is to provide the api and implementation. Think about possible drawbacks of your solution.
What language features from the lecture would you apply here and why?

*NOTE*: while in real life we'd most probably want to use a hardware accelerator for this, in the exercise we use the standard library and the CPU only.
